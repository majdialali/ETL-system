Overview:
In this case, I was asked to create a ETL (Extract, transform, load) system to read in information and fix the human errors, 
structure the information, and then choose a data model to migrate the data from Excel. After that I should do some analysis and make a report.
In the end, I had to present my solution.

Obs. I was given a two days deadline to make this system.

About the data:
The attached  Excel document contains data from a membership register of a small club.
The sheet contains 3 tabs for members, dues and payments.
